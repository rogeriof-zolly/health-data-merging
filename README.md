# health-data-merging
This is a college work for the Advanced Artificial Intelligence discipline to develop on neural networks. The idea is to use health data from PhysioNet repository to analyse patients' exams and pass it throw a neural network that should give the correct illness the output. This project aims to treat the data to be used in Adrena or Tensorflow.
